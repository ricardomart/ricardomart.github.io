                    Note: I also regularly work on small logic and/or programming challenges with
                    <a href="https://julianegerez.github.io">Julian E. Gerez</a>, challenges which we usually find on
                    FiveThirtyEight's <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/the-riddler/">"The Riddler"</a>. After
                    coming up with and implementing a solution together, Julian usually writes a paper describing
                    that solution and the thought process leading up to it, sometimes also including further
                    statistical analysis/modeling that may have interested him. Some of these papers can be found
                    <a href="https://julianegerez.github.io/blog/">here</a>.

                                web app which helps its users create, modify, and render
                                commercial lighting proposals and quotes. In an environment
                                where multiple people are creating proposals simultaneously,
                                existing proposals are constantly being changed, new products
                                are being introduced in a consistent and systematic way, and
                                time-to-market (rather, potential client) is key, LPA comes
                                across as a robust and clean solution.
