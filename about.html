                <p>
                My name is <b>Ricardo M. Martinez</b> and I am a 24-year old
                software engineer from Miami, FL. In May 2017, I
                graduated from Columbia University's Fu Foundation School of
                Engineering and Applied Science with a B.S. in Computer Science.
                The following year, I started working as a software developer at
                Tradebyte Software GmbH, in a small town in Germany called Ansbach.
                The change was dramatic - I was experiencing a new country and a
                new culture, all while working at my first software development
                job - but I quickly got into the swing of things, and before long,
                I was efficiently working with my team on all stages of our applications'
                development lifecycles. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Since I started working at Tradebyte, I've had the fortune of
                working on a project that introduced me to a number of topics
                that I wasn't previously familiar with. Technology-wise: containerization,
                continuous integration and deployment, advanced knowledge of a web
                framework (Django), and cloud computing (AWS); organizationally: agile
                methodologies, kanban boards, JIRA, and Confluence, coordinating the
                inter-process communication of two large software systems, and even working
                in teams of more than 3 people. I've also been tasked with presenting
                that same project to other developers, other departments within the company,
                and then even to clients of the company, all of which have
                helped me to explain technical implementations both at very detailed and
                general levels.
                </p>

                <p>
                My hobbies in tech include exploring all things "Linux". When I'm not
                configuring various desktop environments or tiling window
                managers, I'm always looking for new niche software that could
                improve my computing experience. Recently, I've discovered
                <a href="https://github.com/michael-lazar/rtv">rtv</a>, 
                <a href="https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu">ncdu</a>, and 
                <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">pass</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                Outside of the tech world, I like watching sports (particularly
                football, basketball, and soccer), exercising by running around my city or (more recently)
                bouldering, and growing my still-very-small garden. I also like
                staying in touch with my grandparents and uncle who all live in
                Hamburg, visiting them whenever I can find the time!
                </p>
