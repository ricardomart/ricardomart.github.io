                <p>
                My name is <b>Ricardo M. Martinez</b> and I am a 23-year old
                aspiring software engineer from Miami, FL. In May 2017, I
                graduated from Columbia University's Fu Foundation School of
                Engineering and Applied Science with a B.S. in Computer Science.
                By taking classes covering a broad range of subject material, I
                discovered that I was most drawn to the "agile software
                development" work flow, where I was working collaboratively with
                others and developing a product with changing requirements.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                One such project that I worked on is <b>ImHere</b>, which is an
                online attendance manager designed for use in a classroom
                setting. By combining different technologies
                and developing for a specific customer's use cases, my team and
                I were able to win JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s 2016 Self-Defined
                Project Award. You can learn more about the project
                in the 'Skills & Projects' section above.
                </p>

                <p>
                One of my hobbies is exploring all things "Linux". When I'm not
                configuring various desktop environments or tiling window
                managers, I'm always looking for new niche software that could
                improve my computing experience. Recently, I've discovered
                <a href="https://github.com/michael-lazar/rtv">rtv</a>, 
                <a href="https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu">ncdu</a>, and 
                <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">pass</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                Outside of the tech world, I like watching sports (particularly
                basketball and soccer), exercising by running around South
                Florida, and growing my still-very-small garden. I also like
                staying in touch with my grandparents and uncle who live in
                Germany, forcing me to keep my German in tip-top shape!
                </p>
