                <p>
                    My name is <b>Ricardo Moritz Martinez</b> and I am a
                    software engineer from Miami, FL. In May 2017, I
                    graduated from Columbia University's Fu Foundation School of
                    Engineering and Applied Science with a B.S. in Computer Science.
                    The following year, I started working as a software engineer for
                    Tradebyte Software GmbH in Ansbach, Germany. At the end of June,
		    2020, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, I returned home to my
		    family in the U.S. In January 2021, I began working remotely for
		    Mediaocean, Inc. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Outside of work, I enjoy playing and watching sports (particularly
                    football, basketball, and soccer), and I like running late at night
                    for exercise. When I'm inside, I'll usually be on the computer reading
		    about and experimenting with any number of technical topics that, in some
		    way, involve open-source or linux. I also have dual American/German
		    citizenship (as my work experience in Germany may have hinted at), and
		    regularly stay in touch with and try to visit my grandparents and uncle in
		    Hamburg, Germany.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After having lived in a variety of different places throughout my life (Miami,
                    New York City, Pittsburgh, Ansbach), I would say that I am always open to
                    new experiencing new things and places, always trying to leave my mark!
                </p>
